# Doorbell-Automation
Objective: 
To develop an electronic device that can detect any human activity and switch on the door bell automatically to notify the residents.

Components Required:

1. Raspberry Pi 3 (any model)
2. PIR Sensor
3. Buzzer/LED
4. Breadboard
5. Connecting wires

Brief description:   
Security systems is one of the most researched fields of today.  
The smart device that we will build will have PIR (PASSIVE INFRA RED) sensors which will be placed in the door that detects the human activities over a particular range. 
Our aim is to program the microcontroller in such a way that whenever a human activity is detected by the sensors the door bell will switch on automatically and alert the residents regarding it. 
Further, the related information regarding the human intrusion is updated to the cloud.
